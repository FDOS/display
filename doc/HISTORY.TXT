==== Ver 0.06 (Aitor SANTAMARIA MERINO)
- Added version and copyright notice at boot 
- Added Int2Fh interface, functions 2,3,Eh,Fh
- Added MODECON.EXE to operate with those functions
- Added use of bCPSoft and bCPHard (always 437)
==== Ver 0.07 (Ilya V. Vasilyev)
- Fixed: problems working with VGA
- Minor optimizations and fixes
==== Ver 0.07 (Aitor SANTAMARIA MERINO)
- Minor optimizations and fixes
- Complete rewrite of PREPARE/SELECT: SELECT has an independent pool
- PREPARE Pools: array of pools (as many as you want at compile time) managed 
  with a LRU scheme
- MODECON: PREPARE=PREP, SELECT=SEL (as suggested by Ilya)
- Ready for commandline parsing
==== Ver 0.08 (Aitor SANTAMARIA MERINO)
- commandline syntax
  DISPLAY  devname[:]=(EGA,n,m)
  for n=hardware cp number, m=number of pools to be used
- SELECT: trivial if selected=current
- frees environment block, saving resident space
- Computes correctly the tablesize for EGA adapters (and now yes, it
  should work with EGA!!)
==== Ver 0.09 (Aitor SANTAMARIA MERINO)
- Communicate with other drivers: KEYB, PRINT.COM, ARABIC/HEBREW, GRAFTABL
- Source restructure in a modular way, to make it possible to create DISPLAY 
  or PRINTER
- now reports errors with error codes
- returns information about codepages, AX=AD03h
- uses that table and allows to specify buffer to fill (no longer LRU)
- allows to use more than one hardware codepage at a time (you'll need
  ARABIC/HEBREW)
- Uses different font sizes by using subfonts (if not given: automatically
  detected)
- refuses to load with some versions of DR-KEYB
- hardcoded localisation is possible (English and Spanish are supported)
- if hardware selected, "active buffer" is unused, but codepage kept. E.g.:
    DISPLAY CON=(EGA,437,1)
    MODECON CP PREPARE (850) CP850.RAW
    MODECON CP SELECT 850
    MODECON CP PREPARE (858) CP858.RAW
    MODECON CP SELECT 437
    MODECON CP SELECT 850   ;   succeeeds!!
- improved documentation
- MODECON: reads extended error and reports it
- MODECON: returns errors in errorlevel
- MODECON: MODECON CP now reports full information
- MODECON: MODECON CP REFRESH to refresh current codepage
==== Ver 0.10 (Aitor SANTAMARIA MERINO)
- Ability to parse CPI files in the prepare routine. Only simple CPI files, of
DISPLAY-type, uncompressed, 3 fonts per codepage
==== Ver 0.11 (Aitor SANTAMARIA MERINO)
- Support for CGA (untested)
- Buffers are allocated to XMS when available
- Locks GRAFTABL when DISPLAY is present (returns: not installed, but NOT ok to install)
- Better parsing (now recognises more blank characters)
- Turned into an EXE to bypass kernel bug
- Select buffer is now resizable according to number of subfonts, saves some bytes on CGA and EGA (untested)
- The maximum number of buffers now depends on subfont size (up to 8 instead of 5). Real maximum determined by
  available memory
- FIX: when specifying subfonts explicitely, you could set more than the maximum (was 5, now 8)
==== Ver 0.12 (Aitor SANTAMARIA MERINO)
- Generic IOCTL pseudo-call: generic ioctl request packet support, changing more than one codepage at a time
- BUGFIX: GRAGTABL incompatibility
- BUGFIX: More than one hardware CP makes it not to work properly
- BUGFIX: using 6 buffers makes it crash
