DISPLAY  devicename[:]=(hardwareType,[n|(n1[,n2]...)],[m|(m,p)]) [/V] [/C] [/NOHI]

DISPLAY: Loads console codepage management capabilities

   devicename    a valid device name (which in this version is ignored). Use any
                 (such as CON)
   hardwareType  a supported hardware type label (such as EGA or VGA)
   n             default hardware codepage (for one hardware codepage). It will
                 normally be 437
   n1, n2,...    hardware codepages, if more than one (usually you'll have to use
                 third party ARABIC/HEBREW drivers)
   m             Number of buffer for prepared codepages (1 by default)
   p             Extra hardware-specific parameter
   
   /C            exClusive: does not load if DISPLAY is already present
   /NOHI         Disables ussage of XMS memory for prepared codepages
   /V            Verbose: extended information 
   


Supported hardware:

   VGA           VGA adapters. 3 subfonts will be used in any case

                 EGA adapters
   EGA           Automatically determine the number of subfonts to be used
   EGA 14        Force to use two sub-fonts (8x8 and 8x14)
   EGA 8         Force to use only one sub-font (8x8)
   
   LCD           LCD adapters (same as EGA 8)
   
                 For all the adapters above, the parameter p will try to force
                 the number of subfonts to be used (1=8x8, 2=8x8,8x14, 3=8x8, 8x14, 8x16)
                 whenever hardware allows it

   CGA           CGA adapter (FreeDOS GRAFTABL). Parameter p is ignored


Examples:

   DISPLAY  CON=(VGA,437,1)
   
                 VGA adapter, whose BIOS standard codepage is 437. 1 buffer for
                 software codepage is used.
                 This is the standard for most users.
                 
   DISPLAY CON=(EGA,,2)
   
                 Graphics adapter is EGA or better, but is unknown. BIOS default
                 codepage is also unknown. Two buffers are required.
